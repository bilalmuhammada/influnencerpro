       InfluencerPro ("we, "us") is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy (together with our Terms of Use and any other documents referred to in it) applies to www.InfluencerPro.org (the "Service") and sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be handled by us. In this Privacy Policy, the term "personal data" means information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. We know that you, the user of the Service, are concerned about how we use and disclose personal data. We are dedicated to openness regarding the ways in which we use and disclose personal data, and we are committed to complying with data protection and privacy laws that apply to us. Importantly, we want to give you control over personal data that we process about you when you use the Service. We wish to remind you that this Privacy Policy applies to personal data that we process when you use the Service. It does not apply to any links to third parties' websites and/or services that you may encounter when you use the Service. We encourage you to carefully familiarize yourself with privacy policies applicable to any websites and/or services operated by third parties. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties, such as the Zendesk-provided "Contact Support" and the Hyperwallet-provided “Contact Support” functionality accessible through the Service. Please be aware that other users of the Service may be able to see certain personal data you have submitted to the Service. Therefore, please be careful when sharing personal data about you generally in the Service and with other users of the Service. If you register with the Service, you will create a publicly visible user profile under your username. The profile allows other users of the Service to see for instance your name, location, your picture/avatar and profile text (if such data is provided to us by you) and any social networks you have connected to the Service. Such data may be shown on your profile page. Additional metrics will be privately displayed to you on your profile and can be shared to other organizations if authorized via Social Handshake. BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACCEPT THE PRIVACY PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

(ii) Data Collected Automatically When you use the Service, we automatically collect data that may in certain circumstances constitute personal data: We may place a "cookie" on the hard drive of the device that you use to access the Service. Cookies are text files that are saved on the hard drive of your device by means of your browser, enabling us to recognize your browser for purposes such as automatically authenticating you and logging you in to the Service, saving your preferences and directing relevant content to you. Most of the currently available browsers give you the option of managing cookies by, for example, disabling them entirely, accepting them individually, and deleting saved cookies from your hard drive. We would like to remind you that if you completely disable cookies on your browser, you might not be able to use some features of the Service. We may also place tracking pixels in the Service. A tracking pixel is a transparent graphic image that is placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows for the collection of information regarding the use of the web page that contains the tracking pixel. We use API keys of third-party software to authenticate the user to us. Google Analytics is an element of the Service. By using cookies, Google Analytics collects and stores data such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the website, the Internet Protocol address, and the type of operating system used in the devices used to access the Service. By using a browser plugin http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin/ provided by Google, you can opt out of Google Analytics. We also use the analytics software service providers to provide us with statistical information related to your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, Splunk. The Service uses YouTube API services, where the permissions and access can be managed in Google's security settings. The use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
